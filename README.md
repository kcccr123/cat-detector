Personal learning project.
First foray into ML and classifiers.

Using Scikit-Learn and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), to develop and learn about models for
classifying images.

Model was applied in a basic GUI that prompts the user to upload an image of a cat, which is then
classified and returned.

When running main, creates a simple gui that prompts user to upload an image, and application will process and attempt to return if the image features a cat.
